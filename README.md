Experiments
===========

My experiments with different stuff

Python Module in C:
I tried out implementing a sample Python module in C which invokes the C system call.This example is given in the Python documentation.

For installing the module execute:
	sudo python setup.py install
	
You will need the python-dev package for installing the module.
